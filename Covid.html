<h1 style="font-size: 250%;colour: red;>Create a household plan of action</h1>


<h2 class="error">Talk with the people who need to be included in your plan.</h2>
<p class="use">Meet with household members, other relatives, and friends to discuss what to do if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community and what the needs of each person will be.</p>
<h2 class="error">Plan ways to care for those who might be at greater risk for serious complications.</h2>
<p class="use">From the data that are available for COVID-19 patients, and from data for related coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is possible that older adults and persons who have underlying chronic medical conditions may be at risk for more serious complications. Early data suggest older people are more likely to have serious COVID-19 illness. If you or your household members are at increased risk for COVID-19 complications, please consult with your health care provider for more information about monitoring your health for symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.</p2>
<h2 class="error">Get to know your neighbors.</h2>
<p class="use">Talk with your neighbors about emergency planning. If your neighborhood has a website or social media page, consider joining it to maintain access to neighbors, information, and resources.</p>
<h2 class="error">Identify aid organizations in your community.</h2>
<p class="use">Create a list of local organizations that you and your household can contact in the event you need access to information, health care services, support, and resources. Consider including organizations that provide mental health or counseling services, food, and other supplies.</p>
<h2 class="error">Create an emergency contact list.</h2>
<p class="use">Ensure your household has a current list of emergency contacts for family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, health care providers, teachers, employers, the local public health department, and other community resources.</p>
